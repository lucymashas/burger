Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page.  They can enter as many burgers as they want to eat.  This is a waiting area before they click on a (eat) button that will move the entry to the right side of the page. 

The app store's each burger entry in the database with a status of whether the user has eaten the burger or not.
